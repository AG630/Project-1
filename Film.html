            <div class="text">In 1965, Arnold Schwarzenegger graduated from high school and made a life-changing decision to join the
                Austrian army. Little did he know that this would be the first step towards an extraordinary journey
                that would make him one of the most iconic figures in the world of bodybuilding. Just one month after
                enlisting, he defied the odds and won his first bodybuilding title, Mr. Junior Europe. The competition
                took place in Germany, and Schwarzenegger, driven by his ambition, had left his army base without
                permission to compete. Unfortunately, this act of determination landed him in hot water, and he spent
                the next year in the brig, a holding area for military personnel who have committed offenses. Despite
                this setback, Schwarzenegger remained undeterred and used his time in the brig to reflect on his goals
                and aspirations. Upon his release, he wasted no time in resuming his training, dedicating up to five
                hours a day to sculpting his physique. At the age of twenty, Schwarzenegger's hard work paid off when he
                clinched his first Mr. Universe title.
